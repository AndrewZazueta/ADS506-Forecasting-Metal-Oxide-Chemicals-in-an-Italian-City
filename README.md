# ADS506-Forecasting-Metal-Oxide-Chemicals-in-an-Italian-City
In this project, four different metal oxide chemicals were forecasted in an unnamed Italian City. Time series analysis techniques were utilized to clean and wrangle the data to get optimal modeling conditions. The forecasts were found by building a seasonal autoregressive moving average (SARMA) model, which accurately predicted chemical levels in the air over a month span. P/ACF graphs were made to get an idea of what parameters to use in the SARMA models. AIC, AICc, and BIC were used to evaluate model performance. The data set used for this project can be found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/air+quality.
